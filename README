CMake Qt5 GUI Template
----------------------

You need Qt5 and CMake 2.8.11 or higher

-- Build instructions --

cd /your/project/build
cmake ../
make

./sauklaue


-- Tablet tricks --
For the XP-PEN tablet, load the driver and make sure to set the mapping to "AllScreen". Sauklaue will manipulate the mapping assuming the internal setting is "AllScreen".
